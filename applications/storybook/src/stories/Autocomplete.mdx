# Autocomplete

The Autocomplete component is a more complex variant of a select input also known as a "combo-box".

This component allows a user to select a value or multiple values from a list of options by suggesting options based on what the user types into an input field.

Technically, this is a wrapper around `Dropdown` together with `Option`s proving autocomplete functionality & exposing it via a children render-prop API for the consumer to render whichever anchor input element he or she wishes to.

### Single value

Type 'enl' to see all the options.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="proton-ui-autocomplete--single" />
</Canvas>

### Multiple values

<Canvas>
    <Story id="proton-ui-autocomplete--multiple" />
</Canvas>

### Accessibility

Since this is a component where focus persists inside the anchor even while keyboard navigating through the elements inside its dropdown, accessibility can't be managed via native focus and has to be artifically created via aria attributes. It is for that reason that the `id` prop, which is used internally to link the dropdown contents to it's anchor, is required.

<ArgsTable of={AutocompleteTwo} />

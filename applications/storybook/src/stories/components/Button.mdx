# Button

The button is an essential element of any design. It's meant to look and behave as an interactive element of your page.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-button--sandbox" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-button--variants" />
</Canvas>

<Primary />

# Polymorphic Buttons

A button can also be used in another component, with the `ButtonLike` component

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-button--like" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
